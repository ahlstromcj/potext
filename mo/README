MO Directory for the Potext Library
Chris Ahlstrom
2024-04-10 to 2024-04-10

This directory will contain the *.mo files specific to the potext library,
to translate its text output.

For now, it contains some of the stock files from the gettext-runtime/po
directory, but translated by "msgfmt" to *.mo files.

Note that these *.mo files are distinguished from the ones in
library/tests.
