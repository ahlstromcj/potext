Build Directory for the potext Library

This file merely keeps the build directory around. Just because.
Use the following to clean it without removing it completely:

    $ ./work.sh --clean

The build/latex directory also is removed completely during a --clean
operation.

# vim: sw=4 ts=4 wm=8 et ft=sh
