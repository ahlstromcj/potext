Meson is the build system for the Potext library. While Meson 0.63 should
work, in order to use 'meson.options' instead a 'meson_options.txt',
Meson 1.1 or above should be installed.

In order to simplify life, a POSIX shell script, work.sh, is provided.
The most important options are:

    -   --clean. Removes all build products from the build directory.
    -   --make or no option. Build the library and test code.
    -   --clang. Build the code using the Clang compiler.
    -   --help. Show all available options.

Build:

    $ ./work.sh --clean (if needed)
    $ ./work.sh --clang (if desired, to use Clang)
    $ ./work.sh         (use default compiler)

Test:

    $ ./library/tests/tests.sh

    This script runs all of the tests listed in the file
    './library/tests/testlines.list', plus a couple more.

Install:

    The easiest way to install is to use the work.sh script:

    $ ./work.sh --install

    Of course, one can use Meson without this script if desired. Study the
    script for details.

Subproject:

    If one does not want to install Potext, Meson *.wrap files are
    provided to use Potext as a Meson subproject.

    See extras/wraps/potext-git.wrap in particular.

    -   Make sure the using project is built using Meson.
    -   Create a 'subprojects' directory in the using project.
    -   Copy the desired '.wrap' file from the 'extras/wraps' directory
        into 'subprojects'.
    -   Build!

Build tools:

    -   C/C++ compiler. Currently only use the Mingw compiler setup.
    -   Python
    -   Meson and Ninja. In Windows, they can be installed from
        the same Meson release '*.msi' file.
    -   C++17 and above is required to build Potext. The GNU and Clang
        compilers are supported.
