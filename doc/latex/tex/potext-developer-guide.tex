\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

   The \textsl{potext} libraries adopt, refactor, and greatly extend the
   \textsl{tinygettext} library (\cite{tinygettext}).
   The purpose of that library is to provide a lightweight mechanism
   to do translations using the
   \textsl{Portable Object} translation files, \texttt{*.po}, directly.
   Also incorporated are some elements of the
   \textsl{simple-gettext} library (\cite{simplegettext})
   to support handling \textsl{Machine Object} files, \texttt{*.mo}.

   The purpose of the \textsl{Potext} library is to provide \texttt{C++}
   functions that mirror the many functions of \textsl{gettext},
   including 
   \texttt{textdomain()},
   \texttt{bindtextdomain()},
   \texttt{bind\_textdomain\_codeset()},
   \texttt{gettext()},
   \texttt{dgettext()},
   \texttt{ngettext()},
   and others, for translations made via
   \textsl{GNU PO} files and
   \textsl{GNU MO} files.
   In addition, some of the details of \textsl{tinygettext} 
   are wrapped so that, other than marking the text to be translated,
   the translation setup is done by calling a single function in
   \texttt{main()}.

   Our main goal is to make it easy and lightweight to internationalize
   an application while sticking with \textsl{GNU Gettext}
   conventions.
   The \textsl{GNU Gettext} manual (\cite{gettextman}) is an important
   resource used in writing \textsl{Potext}.
   Also important is the source code at
   \texttt{savannah.gnu.org} (\cite{gettextcode}).

   Note that \textsl{Potext} requires the usage of \texttt{C++17}
   and above. It support builds using the \textsl{GNU} and \textsl{Clang}
   compilers.
   It also requires the use of \textsl{Meson 1.1} and above.
   See the \texttt{INSTALL} file.
   \textsl{Windows} support (apart from \textsl{Mingw} and
   \textsl{Cygwin} will be provided, but it is not ready yet.

\subsection{Additions to Tinygettext}
\label{subsec:introduction_additions}

   \begin{itemize}
      \item Re-implementations of \textsl{gettext/libintl}
         functions as a module
         (collection of functions) in the \texttt{po} namespace.
      \item Integration of the functions above with the
         dictionary-manager class.
      \item Support for selecting a domain during the run.
      \item Support for selecting a \texttt{.po/.mo} file directly
         and getting domain information from it.
      \item A new class, \texttt{nlsbindings}, to supplement the
         \texttt{language} class.
      \item Full documentation of architecture and usage.
      \item \textsl{Meson} \texttt{.wrap} files to use \textsl{Potext}
         as a subproject.
         A sample application project is stored in the tar-file noted
         below.
      \item With version 0.2, \textsl{Potext} can also read
         \textsl{GNU} \texttt{.mo} files for more complete
         compatibility with \textsl{GNU Gettext}.
      \item Additional test programs, test \texttt{.po} files,
         test \texttt{.mo} files, and upgrades to existing tests.
   \end{itemize}

   With these additions, \textsl{Potext} should be relatively straightforward
   to use in a new \texttt{C++} application.
   The tar-ball
   \texttt{extras/code/mini-potext-test.tar.xz}
   contains a simple application using \textsl{Potext} as a sub-project
   stored in \textsl{GitHub}..
   Unpack the tar-ball into its own directory
   and build it by running its
   \texttt{work.sh} script.

\subsection{Deletions from GNU Gettext}
\label{subsec:introduction_deletions}

   \begin{itemize}
      \item Locking has been removed from some \texttt{gettext()}-like
         functions; locking can be put back once testing reveals
        it necessary for the use-cases that \textsl{Potext} supports.
      \item Determining if the binary is running SUID root.
   \end{itemize}

   Currently \textsl{Potext} is meant to be set up once during
   the run of an application.
   It currently does not detect changes to the environment variables
   related to localization and character conversions.
   It assumes that once the setup is made, no localization changes
   will be made. Keeps it simple.

\subsection{Code Changes}
\label{subsec:introduction_changes}

   \begin{itemize}
      \item Changed the coding style and naming conventions for
         (perhaps) easier reading..
      \item Use of initializer lists, rather than brute-force
         assignment statements, for initializing various containers.
      \item Use of the \texttt{auto} keyword in declarations and
         \texttt{for}-loops.
      \item Many additional \texttt{using} directives, most hidden
         in the \texttt{po} namespace or in a class declaration..
      \item A few additional helper classes have been added to provide
         new features.
   \end{itemize}

   These changes are meant to make the code easier to read and understand.

\subsection{Future Work}
\label{subsec:introduction_future}

   \begin{itemize}
      \item Hammer on this code in \textsl{Windows}.
      \item Work out the installation process; including \texttt{.po}
         and \texttt{.mo} file
         installation and copying (if desired)
         to the user's configuration directory.
      \item Handle capitals, punctuation, etc. without additional
         \texttt{.po}/\texttt{.mo} entries.
      \item Get the handling of categories (e.g. \texttt{LC\_TIME}) to
         work. However, note that the category is almost always
         \texttt{LC\_MESSAGES}, so this is a low priority.
      \item Handle the "C" locale as discussed below.
      \item Allow for the user to override the character set via the
         \texttt{OUTPUT\_CHARSET} environment variable.
      \item Add support to assist a \textsl{Potext}-using project with the
         installation of the \texttt{.po} files.
   \end{itemize}

   Ignore \texttt{LANGUAGE} and its system-dependent analog if the locale is
   set to "C" because:

   \begin{enumber}
      \item "C" locale uses the ASCII encoding; most international
         messages use non-ASCII characters, which get displayed
         as question marks or as invalid 8-bit characters.
      \item The precise output of some programs in the "C" locale
         is specified by POSIX and should not depend on environment
         variables like \texttt{LANGUAGE}.  Such programs can use
         \texttt{gettext()}.
   \end{enumber}

   Also ignore \texttt{LANGUAGE} and its system-dependent analog if the
   locale is \texttt{C.UTF-8} or \texttt{C.<encoding>}; that's
   the by-design behaviour for \texttt{glibc}, see
   \url{https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Proposals/C.UTF-8}.
   Also look in \texttt{/usr/lib/locale/C.utf8}.

\subsection{Naming Conventions}
\label{subsec:introduction_conventions}

   \textsl{Potext} uses some conventions for naming things in this
   document.

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{\$prefix}. The base location for installation of
         the application and its ancillary data files on
         \textsl{UNIX/Linux/BSD}:
         \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{/usr/}
            \item \texttt{/usr/local/}
         \end{itemize}
      \item \texttt{\$winprefix}. The base location for installation of
         the application and its ancillary data files on \textsl{Windows}.
         \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{C:/Program Files/}
            \item \texttt{C:/Program Files (x86)/}
         \end{itemize}
      \item \texttt{\$podir}. The installed location of the \texttt{*.po}
         files.  The directory \texttt{share} (\textsl{Linux}) or
         \texttt{data} (\textsl{Windows}),
         the package-name of the application
         (\texttt{PACKAGE}), and \texttt{po} are concatenated,
         and again the conventions differ between operating systems.
         \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{/usr/share/PACKAGE/po/}
            \item \texttt{/usr/local/share/PACKAGE/po/}
            \item \texttt{C:/Program Files/PACKAGE/data/po/}
            \item \texttt{C:/Program Files (x86)/PACKAGE/data/po/}
         \end{itemize}
      \item \texttt{\$home}. The alternate installed
         location of the \texttt{*.po} files.
         Not to be confused with \texttt{\$HOME}, this is
         the standard location for configuration files.
         On a UNIX-style system, it would be \linebreak
         \texttt{\$HOME/.config/appname}.
         The files would be put into a \texttt{po} subdirectory here.
      \item \texttt{\$localedir}. The installed
         location of the \texttt{*.mo} files.
         The directory \texttt{share} (\textsl{Linux})
         or \texttt{data} (\textsl{Windows}),
         the package-name of the application
         (\texttt{PACKAGE}), and \texttt{locale} are concatenated.
         The conventions for \textsl{Linux} versus \textsl{Windows}
         differ as a matter of historical interest:
         \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{/usr/share/PACKAGE/locale/}
            \item \texttt{/usr/local/share/PACKAGE/locale/}
            \item \texttt{C:/Program Files/PACKAGE/data/locale/}
            \item \texttt{C:/Program Files (x86)/PACKAGE/data/locale/}
         \end{itemize}
            At present, \textsl{Potext} does not support directories of
            \texttt{.mo} files. It might, in the future.
      \item \texttt{\$modir} and \texttt{LC\_MESSAGES}.
            A more common convention for
            \texttt{*.mo} files on \textsl{UNIX} is to put them in
         \begin{itemize}
            \item \texttt{/usr/share/locale/<language>/LC\_MESSAGES/PACKAGE.mo}
            \item \texttt{/usr/local/share/locale/<language>/LC\_MESSAGES/PACKAGE.mo}.
         \end{itemize}
   \end{itemize}

   Currently, the \textsl{Potext} library uses only the \texttt{*.po} files.
   In the future it might also handle \texttt{*.mo} files.
   Also note that various applications differ in the exact location of their
   translation files.

\subsection{Home Potext Configuration}
\label{subsec:introduction_home_potext_configuration}

   The \textsl{Potext} library also supports installing the
   \texttt{*.po} and \texttt{*.mo} translation files in the
   user's configuration area.
   The conventions we use are:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{\$home}. The location where \texttt{PACKAGE} installs,
         creates, or copies its configuration files.
         Do not confuse it with \texttt{\$HOME},
         although \texttt{\$home} is in
         \texttt{\$HOME/.config/PACKAGE}.
         The \texttt{*.po} files are stored in
         \texttt{\$HOME/.config/PACKAGE/po}.
      \item \texttt{\$winhome}. This location is different for
         \textsl{Windows}:
         \texttt{C:/Users/user/AppData/Local/PACKAGE}.
         Again, the \texttt{*.po} files are in a
         subdirectory called \texttt{po}.
   \end{itemize}

   Also, for reference, we mention some of the files used by
   \textsl{GNU Gettext}.

   \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{PACKAGE.pot}, created by \texttt{xgettext}.
      \item \texttt{LANG.po}, created by \texttt{msgmerge},
         copying \texttt{PACKAGE.pot}, or by editing.
      \item \texttt{LANG.gmo}, created by \texttt{msgfmt}.
      \item For installed packages, see
         \texttt{\$prefix/locale/LANG/PACKAGE.mo}.
      \item Or see
         \texttt{\$prefix/locale-langpack}.
         \texttt{LC\_category} (e.g. \texttt{LC\_NUMERIC}).
      \item \texttt{LANG/PACKAGE.po}, reverse engineered from
         \texttt{PACKAGE.mo} by \texttt{msgunfmt}.
   \end{itemize}

   Also refer to the \textsl{Python} packages \textsl{polib} (\cite{polib})
   and \textsl{poedit} (\cite{poedit}).

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

   Contact: If you have ideas about \textsl{Potext} or a bug report,
   please email us (at \url{mailto:ahlstromcj@gmail.com}).

   Remaining issues:

   The \texttt{*.po} files "msgid" and "msgstr" entries have punctuation marks
   and trailing spaces that are significant.
   CAN WE GET AROUND THIS ISSUE?
   We need to trim these trailing characters in both specifications,
   and also when translating, and restore them in the translation.
