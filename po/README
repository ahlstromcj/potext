Po Directory for the potext Library
Chris Ahlstrom
2024-02-17 to 2024-02-25

This directory will contain the *.po files specific to the potext library,
to translate its text output.

For now, it contains some of the stock files from the gettext-runtime/po
directory, but only a small sampling of the *.po files.

Note that these *.po files are distinguished from the ones in
library/tests.
